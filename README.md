# _Pixel Art Maker Project_

#### _September 16, 2019_

#### _Overview_

_This is my implementation of Udacity's Pixel Art Maker. I built a single-page application that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas._

_Starter code was provided including HTML and CSS to build the application. I wrote plain JavaScript code without using JQuery, that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece._

_The user is able to:_

_1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid._
_2. Choose a color._
_3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color._

#### _Programming Skills I Used_

_In this project I used my front-end programming skills, including:_

_* Defining variables with `const` and `let`_
_* Accessing the DOM using methods of the `document` object_
_* Declaring functions and attaching them to the DOM objects as event listeners_
_* Writing nested loops and using loop variables_
_* Writing plain JavaScript code to interact with the DOM without using the JQuery library._
_* Writing this README.md file using Markdown syntax._
_* Deploying to app to Github pages._
